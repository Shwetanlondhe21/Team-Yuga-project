# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Develop a web application designed to enhance students' practical understanding of computer and information technology concepts. By integrating Augmented Reality (AR), 3D Models, Gamification, and AI-driven features, the app provides an interactive and immersive learning experience. This solution bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills, helping students visualize complex IT concepts in real-time using AR. Gamified elements boost engagement and motivation, while AI personalizes the learning journey. Ultimately, the application prepares students to meet industry needs by developing essential skills and a deeper understanding of IT concepts.
